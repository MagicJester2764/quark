# Quark syscall ABI

**Version 1.2.** Query the running kernel with `SYS_ABI_VERSION` (240), which
returns `(major << 16) | minor`.

This document is the contract between the Quark kernel and everything above it.
A service, a language runtime, or a C library should be buildable against this
document alone, without reading kernel source.

## Calling convention

```
RAX = syscall number
RDI = arg0   RSI = arg1   RDX = arg2   R10 = arg3   R8 = arg4   R9 = arg5
```

Entry is `syscall`/`sysret` via the STAR/LSTAR/SFMASK MSRs. The return value is
in RAX. R10 is used rather than RCX because `syscall` clobbers RCX with the
return address.

The kernel clobbers RDI, RSI, RDX, R8, R9 and R10; callers must treat them as
volatile. Caller-saved scratch registers are scrubbed before `sysret` so kernel
values do not leak back to user space. RFLAGS.AC is cleared on entry by SFMASK,
so a task cannot pre-open the SMAP window before trapping in.

## Return encoding

There is no `errno`. Each call returns a single `u64`:

- **`u64::MAX` (`0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF`) means failure.** No call returns it as
  a success value.
- Everything else is call-specific: a handle, a count, a packed struct, or `0`
  for "succeeded, nothing to report".

Two calls deviate deliberately and say so below: `SYS_CALL_TIMEOUT` returns `1`
for a timeout, because timing out is an answer rather than a failure to ask; and
`SYS_FD_READ_NB` returns `0xFFFF_FFFE` for "would block", distinct from `0`,
which is end of file.

This is deliberately coarse. It is enough to build a libc's `errno` on top of
only where a call is extended to report a reason; do not assume a failing call
tells you *why* it failed.

## Numbering

Numbers are assigned in 16-slot blocks, one subsystem per block, so a new call
lands beside its relatives rather than in whatever gap happens to be free. The
unused slots in a block are reserved for that subsystem.

| Block | Range     | Subsystem                     |
|-------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| 0x00  | 0–15      | Process lifecycle             |
| 0x10  | 16–31     | IPC                           |
| 0x20  | 32–47     | Memory                        |
| 0x30  | 48–63     | Shared memory                 |
| 0x40  | 64–79     | File descriptors and pipes    |
| 0x50  | 80–95     | Capabilities                  |
| 0x60  | 96–111    | Task lifecycle and identity   |
| 0x70  | 112–127   | Hardware and drivers          |
| 0x80  | 128–143   | Synchronisation               |
| 0x90  | 144–159   | Time                          |
| 0xA0  | 160–175   | Kernel debug console          |
| 0xF0  | 240–255   | ABI introspection             |

Blocks 0xB0–0xE0 are unassigned and available for new subsystems — sockets and
threads are the two expected to claim one.

## Stability and deprecation

- **Numbers are never reused.** A withdrawn call leaves its slot empty. A
  program built against an older minor version that calls a withdrawn number
  gets a clean failure rather than a different call's behaviour.
- **Minor version** increases when calls are added. Additions never move or
  change existing calls, so an older program keeps working.
- **Major version** increases when a call's meaning, arguments, or return
  encoding changes incompatibly. A program should read `SYS_ABI_VERSION` and
  refuse to run against a major it was not built for.
- **Deprecation is a three-step process**: mark the call deprecated in this
  document with its replacement; keep it working for at least one major
  version; then withdraw it and leave the slot empty.

### What each minor added

| Version | Added |
|---|---|
| 1.0 | The ABI as first frozen. |
| 1.1 | `SYS_ADDRSPACE_SELF` (41), `SYS_SET_FS_BASE` (102), `SYS_TASK_START_ARG` (103) — what a thread needs: the caller's own address space to share, a per-task FS base for thread-local storage, and an argument to hand the new thread. |
| 1.2 | `SYS_FUTEX_WAIT_TIMEOUT` (130). |

Five calls are **deprecated as of 1.0** — the `CAP_*` object-capability calls
(80–85) replace them:

| Call | Number | Why | Replacement |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SYS_GRANT_CAP` | 86 | Expands a bitmask bit into a *wildcard* capability, e.g. `CAP_MAP_PHYS` becomes `PhysRange(0, 4 GiB)`, silently widening any narrow grant made alongside it | `SYS_CAP_MINT` + `SYS_CAP_GRANT` |
| `SYS_GRANT_IOPORT` | 87 | Same, for the full port range | `SYS_CAP_MINT` with `IoPort(start, end)` |
| `SYS_GRANT_IRQ` | 88 | Same shape | `SYS_CAP_MINT` with `Irq(n)` |
| `SYS_SET_USER_CAPS` | 89 | Per-UID authority predates capabilities and is not consulted by anything that grants correctly | per-task CSpace |
| `SYS_GET_USER_CAPS` | 90 | as above | per-task CSpace |

New code must not call these. See `CLAUDE.md` for why granting `CAP_MAP_PHYS`
in particular undoes an otherwise careful capability grant.

## Capabilities

Authority comes from capabilities, not from a privilege level — there is no
UID 0 bypass in the kernel. Each task has a CSpace of 16 slots holding
`CapSlot { cap_type, generation, root_slot, root_tid, param0, param1 }`.

| Type | param0 | param1 |
|---|---|---|
| `IoPort` | first port | last port |
| `PhysRange` | first address | last address (page aligned) |
| `Irq` | IRQ number (`0xFF` = any) | — |
| `TaskMgmt` | target TID (`0` = any) | — |
| `PhysAlloc` | max pages (`0` = unlimited) | — |
| `SetUid` | — | — |
| `Endpoint` | bitmask of destination TIDs | — |

Delegation may narrow a capability but never widen it; delegating at equal
breadth is allowed, since a set is a subset of itself.

## The calls

`Cap` names the capability required. `—` means none. Blocking calls are marked;
everything else returns promptly.

### Process lifecycle (0x00)

| # | Name | Arguments | Returns | Cap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `SYS_EXIT` | — | does not return | — |
| 1 | `SYS_EXIT_CODE` | arg0 = status | does not return | — |
| 2 | `SYS_YIELD` | — | 0 | — |
| 3 | `SYS_GETPID` | — | current TID | — |
| 4 | `SYS_WAIT` | — | `tid \| (exit_code << 32)`, or `u64::MAX` if no children. **Blocks.** | — |
| 5 | `SYS_TASK_KILL` | arg0 = tid | 0 / `u64::MAX` | `TaskMgmt` for target, or same UID |
| 6 | `SYS_SIGNAL` | arg0 = tid, arg1 = signal bits | 0 / `u64::MAX` | as above |
| 7 | `SYS_TASK_INFO` | arg0 = tid | packed info, or `u64::MAX` | — |

`SYS_EXIT` is equivalent to `SYS_EXIT_CODE(0)`; it exists separately because
`syscall0` leaves RDI undefined, so the original call could not grow an
argument.

### IPC (0x10)

Messages are fixed size: sender TID, a `u64` tag, and six `u64` payload words.

| # | Name | Arguments | Returns | Cap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 16 | `SYS_SEND` | arg0 = dest, arg1 = msg | 0 / `u64::MAX`. **Blocks** until received. | `Endpoint` for dest |
| 17 | `SYS_RECV` | arg0 = from (`TID_ANY` for any), arg1 = msg out | 0 / `u64::MAX`. **Blocks.** | — |
| 18 | `SYS_CALL` | arg0 = dest, arg1 = msg, arg2 = reply out | 0 / `u64::MAX`. **Blocks** until replied. | `Endpoint` for dest |
| 19 | `SYS_REPLY` | arg0 = dest, arg1 = msg | 0 / `u64::MAX` | — |
| 20 | `SYS_CALL_TIMEOUT` | arg0 = dest, arg1 = msg, arg2 = reply out, arg3 = ticks | **0 = replied, 1 = timed out**, `u64::MAX` = failed. **Blocks** up to the deadline. | `Endpoint` for dest |
| 21 | `SYS_RECV_TIMEOUT` | arg0 = from, arg1 = msg out, arg2 = ticks | 0 / `u64::MAX`. **Blocks** up to the deadline. | — |
| 22 | `SYS_NOTIFY` | arg0 = dest, arg1 = badge | 0 / `u64::MAX` | `Endpoint` for dest |

The `Endpoint` check applies to calls where the sender names its own
destination. IPC the kernel performs on a task's behalf through an installed
file descriptor bypasses it deliberately: the fd is itself the authorisation,
and only a `TaskMgmt` holder can install one.

`SYS_NOTIFY` rejects the reserved signal bits; those may only be raised through
`SYS_SIGNAL`, which checks the caller's authority over the target.

Prefer `SYS_CALL_TIMEOUT` over `SYS_CALL` for any destination not known to be a
running server. A TID is not a promise that anything is listening, and a plain
call to a task that never reaches `SYS_RECV` blocks forever.

### Memory (0x20)

| # | Name | Arguments | Returns | Cap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 32 | `SYS_MMAP` | arg0 = vaddr, arg1 = pages | 0 / `u64::MAX` | — (quota enforced) |
| 33 | `SYS_MUNMAP` | arg0 = vaddr, arg1 = pages | 0 / `u64::MAX` | — |
| 34 | `SYS_PHYS_ALLOC` | arg0 = pages | physical address / `u64::MAX` | `PhysAlloc` |
| 35 | `SYS_PHYS_FREE` | arg0 = phys, arg1 = count | 0 / `u64::MAX` | `PhysAlloc` + frame ownership |
| 36 | `SYS_ADDRSPACE_CREATE` | — | CR3 / `u64::MAX` | `TaskMgmt` |
| 37 | `SYS_ADDRSPACE_MAP` | arg0 = cr3, arg1 = virt, arg2 = phys, arg3 = pages, arg4 = flags | 0 / `u64::MAX` | `TaskMgmt` + frame ownership or `PhysRange` |
| 38 | `SYS_MAP_PHYS` | arg0 = phys, arg1 = virt, arg2 = pages | 0 / `u64::MAX` | frame ownership or `PhysRange` |
| 39 | `SYS_SET_MEM_LIMIT` | arg0 = tid, arg1 = pages (0 = unlimited) | 0 / `u64::MAX` | `TaskMgmt` |
| 40 | `SYS_SET_PAGER` | arg0 = tid, arg1 = pager tid | 0 / `u64::MAX` | `TaskMgmt` |

**Mapping authority is ownership first, `PhysRange` second.** A task may map
frames it owns — `SYS_PHYS_ALLOC` records the caller as owner — with no
capability at all, since handing back memory the allocator just gave you conveys
no new authority. `PhysRange` is required only for frames the allocator never
owned (device MMIO, the framebuffer) and for pages another task allocated.

**All user mappings must be at or above `USER_MIN_ADDR` (0x80_0000_0000).**
Lower addresses are rejected: address spaces share the page directories beneath
PML4[0], so a low mapping would write into tables every address space shares.

Physical addresses are page aligned; a request that is not is rejected.

### Shared memory (0x30)

| # | Name | Arguments | Returns | Cap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 48 | `SYS_SHMEM_CREATE` | arg0 = pages | handle / `u64::MAX` | — (charged to creator's quota) |
| 49 | `SYS_SHMEM_MAP` | arg0 = handle, arg1 = vaddr | 0 / `u64::MAX` | must have been granted |
| 50 | `SYS_SHMEM_UNMAP` | arg0 = handle, arg1 = vaddr | 0 / `u64::MAX` | — |
| 51 | `SYS_SHMEM_GRANT` | arg0 = handle, arg1 = target tid | 0 / `u64::MAX` | must be the creator |
| 52 | `SYS_SHMEM_DESTROY` | arg0 = handle | 0 / `u64::MAX` | must be the creator |

Destruction is deferred while any mapping remains. Futexes are keyed on physical
address, so a futex word inside a shared region is one object to every task that
maps it.

### File descriptors and pipes (0x40)

Eight descriptors per task. 0, 1 and 2 are stdin, stdout and stderr by
convention. A descriptor is one of: unset, an IPC endpoint (a service TID plus a
tag), a pipe read end, or a pipe write end.

| # | Name | Arguments | Returns | Cap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 64 | `SYS_FD_READ` | arg0 = fd, arg1 = buf, arg2 = max len | bytes read, `0` = EOF, `u64::MAX` = error. **Blocks.** | — |
| 65 | `SYS_FD_WRITE` | arg0 = fd, arg1 = buf, arg2 = len | bytes written / `u64::MAX` | — |
| 66 | `SYS_FD_READ_NB` | arg0 = fd, arg1 = buf, arg2 = max len | bytes, `0` = EOF, **`0xFFFF_FFFE` = would block**, `u64::MAX` = error | — |
| 67 | `SYS_FD_SET` | arg0 = target tid, arg1 = fd, arg2 = service tid, arg3 = tag | 0 / `u64::MAX` | `TaskMgmt` |
| 68 | `SYS_FD_DUP` | arg0 = target tid, arg1 = target fd, arg2 = source fd | 0 / `u64::MAX` | `TaskMgmt` |
| 69 | `SYS_PIPE_CREATE` | — | handle / `u64::MAX` | — (bounded per task) |
| 70 | `SYS_PIPE_FD_SET` | arg0 = target tid, arg1 = fd, arg2 = pipe handle, arg3 = 1 for write end | 0 / `u64::MAX` | `TaskMgmt` |

`SYS_PIPE_CREATE` needs no capability because a shell needs it for pipelines.
Pipes are reference counted through the descriptors that hold them; a read
returns EOF once the last writer closes, and a pipe is freed when both counts
reach zero.

Note that `SYS_PIPE_FD_SET` **overwrites** the target slot without releasing
what was there. Install pipe ends onto a descriptor a task has not already
inherited, or the previous endpoint's reference is stranded.

### Capabilities (0x50)

| # | Name | Arguments | Returns | Cap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 80 | `SYS_CAP_MINT` | arg0 = slot, arg1 = type, arg2 = param0, arg3 = param1 | 0 / `u64::MAX` | must already hold one covering it |
| 81 | `SYS_CAP_GRANT` | arg0 = dest tid, arg1 = src slot, arg2 = dest slot | 0 / `u64::MAX` | — |
| 82 | `SYS_CAP_REVOKE` | arg0 = slot | 0 / `u64::MAX` | must be the minter |
| 83 | `SYS_CAP_INSPECT` | arg0 = slot | packed descriptor | — |
| 84 | `SYS_CAP_DELETE` | arg0 = slot | 0 / `u64::MAX` | — |
| 85 | `SYS_CAP_TRANSFER` | arg0 = dest tid, arg1 = bits | 0 / `u64::MAX` | — |
| 86–90 | *deprecated* | see the deprecation table above | | |

`SYS_CAP_INSPECT` truncates parameters and cannot report a 64-bit destination
set, so an `Endpoint` capability must be **delegated** with `SYS_CAP_GRANT`
rather than read back and re-minted.

Revocation is generation-based; a capability minted into a slot carries that
slot's generation, and revoking bumps it. The counter is 32 bits, so wraparound
cannot resurrect a revoked capability in practice.

### Task lifecycle and identity (0x60)

| # | Name | Arguments | Returns | Cap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 96 | `SYS_TASK_CREATE` | — | TID / `u64::MAX` | `TaskMgmt` |
| 97 | `SYS_TASK_START` | arg0 = tid, arg1 = rip, arg2 = rsp, arg3 = cr3 | 0 / `u64::MAX` | `TaskMgmt` |
| 98 | `SYS_GET_UID` | — | current UID | — |
| 99 | `SYS_SET_UID` | arg0 = tid, arg1 = uid | 0 / `u64::MAX` | `SetUid` |
| 100 | `SYS_SET_GID` | arg0 = tid, arg1 = gid | 0 / `u64::MAX` | `SetUid` |
| 101 | `SYS_GET_TUID` | arg0 = tid | that task's UID | — |

There is no fork or exec. A parent creates a task, builds its address space,
loads its image, sets its arguments and capabilities, then starts it. TIDs are
reused once a task is reaped, so a TID identifies a task only for as long as
that task lives — see the note on `Endpoint` revocation below.

`SYS_GET_TUID` exists for servers doing permission checks on behalf of a
caller: the VFS uses it to evaluate file modes against the requester.

### Hardware and drivers (0x70)

| # | Name | Arguments | Returns | Cap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 112 | `SYS_IRQ_REGISTER` | arg0 = irq | 0 / `u64::MAX` | `Irq` for that line |
| 113 | `SYS_IRQ_ACK` | arg0 = irq | 0 / `u64::MAX` | `Irq` for that line |
| 114 | `SYS_IOPORT` | arg0 = port, arg1 = op, arg2 = value | read value, or 0 / `u64::MAX` | `IoPort` covering the port |
| 115 | `SYS_IOPORT_REP` | arg0 = port, arg1 = buf, arg2 = words, arg3 = op | 0 / `u64::MAX` | `IoPort` covering the port |

`SYS_IOPORT` ops: 0 = read8, 1 = write8, 2 = read16, 3 = write16, 4 = read32,
5 = write32. `SYS_IOPORT_REP` ops: 0 = `rep insw`, 1 = `rep outsw`.

Interrupts are delivered to the registered task as notifications through a
per-IRQ ring buffer, polled in `SYS_RECV`.

### Synchronisation (0x80)

| # | Name | Arguments | Returns | Cap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 128 | `SYS_FUTEX_WAIT` | arg0 = addr (4-byte aligned), arg1 = expected | 0 = woken, 1 = value already differed, `u64::MAX` = bad address or no wait slot. **Blocks.** | — |
| 129 | `SYS_FUTEX_WAKE` | arg0 = addr, arg1 = max to wake | number woken | — |
| 130 | `SYS_FUTEX_WAIT_TIMEOUT` | arg0 = addr, arg1 = expected, arg2 = ticks | 0 = woken, 1 = value already differed, 2 = timed out, `u64::MAX` = bad address or no wait slot. **Blocks.** | — |

Futexes are keyed on **physical** address, so a word in shared memory is one
futex to every task that maps it, whatever virtual address each uses.

A timeout of 0 ticks makes `SYS_FUTEX_WAIT_TIMEOUT` a check rather than a wait:
it returns 1 if the value already differs and 2 if it does not, without
blocking. There is no way to ask for an unbounded wait through this call; that
is what `SYS_FUTEX_WAIT` is.

A timed wait that expires leaves its wait slot claimed until the woken task
returns through the kernel and reads why it woke, so a task blocked on a futex
holds its slot from the moment it waits to the moment it runs again. With
`MAX_FUTEX_WAITERS` slots in total, a caller that gets `u64::MAX` should treat
it as a resource limit rather than as a bad argument.

### Time (0x90)

| # | Name | Arguments | Returns | Cap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 144 | `SYS_TICKS` | — | ticks since boot | — |

The PIT runs at 100 Hz, so one tick is 10 ms. Every timeout argument in this
ABI is in ticks.

### Kernel debug console (0xA0)

| # | Name | Arguments | Returns | Cap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 160 | `SYS_WRITE` | arg0 = buf, arg1 = len | bytes written / `u64::MAX` | — |
| 161 | `SYS_CONSOLE_POS` | — | packed `(row, col)` | — |

These write to the kernel's own console, bypassing the user-space console
server. They exist for bring-up and for output before a console exists.
**Expect them to be withdrawn** once early output is handled another way;
ordinary programs should use file descriptor 1.

### ABI introspection (0xF0)

| # | Name | Arguments | Returns | Cap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 240 | `SYS_ABI_VERSION` | — | `(major << 16) \| minor` | — |

## User pointers

Every pointer a caller passes is validated as **mapped**, not merely in range:
the kernel runs on the caller's CR3, so an in-range but unmapped address would
fault inside the kernel, possibly with a lock held and interrupts off. Reads and
writes are checked separately, and a null pointer is rejected.

SMEP and SMAP are enabled when the CPU reports them. The kernel touches user
memory only inside a narrow guard that sets RFLAGS.AC, and never holds that
guard across a blocking operation, so a syscall that blocks mid-copy cannot
leave the window open for whatever runs next.

## Notes for implementers

**TID reuse.** Reaping returns a task slot to the pool, so TIDs are recycled.
Anything that names a task by number must cope with the name changing meaning:
the kernel clears a dead TID's bit from every `Endpoint` capability for exactly
this reason. Do not cache a TID across the lifetime of the task it named.

**No threads yet.** `x86_64-unknown-quark` sets `singlethread: true`. A libc or
runtime port should expect a single thread of execution per address space until
the ABI gains a thread block.

**Services are found by name.** The nameserver is at a well-known TID and maps
names to TIDs (`TAG_LOOKUP`), and back (`TAG_LOOKUP_TID`). Every IPC server also
answers `TAG_PING` with an empty reply, which is the portable way to ask whether
one is alive. Note that not every service is an IPC server — the console is
driven by a pipe and does not answer.
